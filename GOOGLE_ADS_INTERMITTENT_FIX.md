# Google Ads Intermittent "Unreliable Claims" Fix

## üî¥ ROOT CAUSE OF INTERMITTENT REJECTIONS

Your site is experiencing **intermittent** Google Ads rejections because:

### 1. **Old Version Still Accessible**
- **CRITICAL**: The `FRANKLOAN-master (5)WORKING` folder contains an old version with violations
- This folder has "Quick and Easy Loans" and other non-compliant language
- Google may be randomly crawling different versions

### 2. **Dynamic Content Issues**
- Success messages show "Loan Approved!" without qualifiers
- Some dynamic states may display non-compliant language

### 3. **Incomplete Deployment**
- Changes may not be fully deployed to production
- CDN caching might serve old content intermittently

---

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. **Delete or Move Old Folders**
```bash
# Option A: Delete the old version (RECOMMENDED)
rm -rf "FRANKLOAN-master (5)WORKING"
rm -rf "PAYMENT"
rm -rf "paymentmodal"

# Option B: Move to backup location outside project
mv "FRANKLOAN-master (5)WORKING" ../backup/
mv "PAYMENT" ../backup/
mv "paymentmodal" ../backup/
```

### 2. **Updated robots.txt** (Already Done)
```txt
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Disallow: /api/
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /payment/
Disallow: /dashboard/
Disallow: /FRANKLOAN-master/
Disallow: /paymentmodal/
Disallow: /PAYMENT/
```

### 3. **Clear All Caches**
```bash
# Clear build cache
npm run clean
npm run build

# Clear CDN cache (if using Cloudflare/Netlify)
# Go to your CDN dashboard and purge all cache
```

### 4. **Verify Production Deployment**
```bash
# Check what's actually deployed
curl -I https://yoursite.com
curl https://yoursite.com/robots.txt
curl https://yoursite.com/terms
curl https://yoursite.com/privacy
```

  to = "/404"
  status = 404

[[redirects]]
  from = "/paymentmodal/*"
  to = "/404"
  status = 404
```

### 3. **Vercel Configuration** (if using Vercel)
Update `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/FRANKLOAN-master/(.*)", "destination": "/404" },
    { "source": "/PAYMENT/(.*)", "destination": "/404" },
    { "source": "/paymentmodal/(.*)", "destination": "/404" }
  ]
}
```

```
