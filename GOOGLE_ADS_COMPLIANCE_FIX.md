---

## Problems Identified

### üî¥ Critical Policy Violations

#### 1. **Absolute Approval Guarantees**
- ‚ùå "Get approved regardless of your credit history"
- ‚ùå "No CRB Check" (implies guaranteed approval)
- **Why it's problematic**: Google prohibits claims that guarantee approval without proper qualification

#### 2. **Unqualified "Instant" Claims**
- ‚ùå "With Instant Cash"
- ‚ùå "Get instant loans"
- ‚ùå "Instant money transfer to your MPESA"
- ‚ùå "Instant disbursement"
- **Why it's problematic**: "Instant" claims must be qualified and accurate; financial services typically can't deliver truly instant results

#### 3. **Specific Time Guarantees**
- ‚ùå "Get approved in minutes, not days"
- ‚ùå "2-minute approval"
- **Why it's problematic**: Specific time promises that can't be consistently met are considered unreliable claims

#### 4. **"100%" Claims**
- ‚ùå "100% digital application process"
- **Why it's problematic**: Absolute percentage claims require substantiation

#### 5. **Missing Legal Requirements**
- ‚ùå No APR disclosure
- ‚ùå No Terms & Conditions page
- ‚ùå No Privacy Policy
- ‚ùå No loan disclaimers
- **Why it's problematic**: Financial services must provide transparent terms, conditions, and regulatory disclosures
